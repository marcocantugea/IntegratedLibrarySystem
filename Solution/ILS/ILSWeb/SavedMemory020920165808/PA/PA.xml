Well - maintained stock records  will ensure that parts required for the maintenance of the vehicle systems are always  available when required, and are quickly located.   6.2.2   Master Inventory List     The master  inventory list is a complete manifest of all the stock to be held with ROV  systems. The list shall be referenced for an explanation of how to use it.   6.2.3   Daily Stock Movements Sheet     Any person removing or replacing stock from the ROV system shall use this she et,  which will be kept on a clipboard, mounted on the wall adjacent to the entrance of the  workshop container.     At the end of each shift the Supervisor will transfer the information from the Daily Stock  Movement Sheet to the Stock Control Sheets located at   the back of each Stock Master  Sheet.     The Stock Control Sheet shall record all stock movements and when completed shall  indicate to the ROV Supervisor when stock requires to be reordered. A benchmark for  the re - ordering of stock items shall be 50% of the  maximum stock levels. This shall  allow time for   shipment of replacement items.   6.2.4   Rolling Stock Checks     A rolling stock check system shall be implemented during the period an ROV systems  is offshore. It is the responsibility of the Supervisor to ensure that t hese stock checks  are done on a quarterly basis and the inventory updated.

O PERATIONAL  G UIDELINES   10.1   Task Briefing     It is imperative that good communications are established between the ROV Supervisor, OCS,  Vessel Master and Company Representatives, in particular before each dive.     The ROV Supervisor must be aware of any  problems associated with the tasks to be  accomplished prior to commencing the dive. He must also be fully aware of the weather  forecast and any strong currents and sub - surface visibility limits in the locality.     It is essential that a Risk Assessment be co nducted before any new task commences. A copy  of the Risk Assessment Form can be found in the Kreuz Subsea PTE Limited manual KS - Q - PR - 032 Hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control.     During 24 - hour operations, the Senior ROV Supervisor shall a lso brief the Shift Supervisor in  detail prior to handing over the shift. The Shift Supervisor must advise the Senior ROV  Supervisor, or the senior Kreuz Subsea person onboard if a major problem or breakdown is  likely to cause a delay exceeding 2 hours.     B oth Supervisors must fully brief the rest of the team prior to commencing each dive.     Safety Harnesses and Life Vests must be worn during any over the side work periods.  Harnesses shall be attached to an inertia reel system.     Under no ordinary  circumstances are non - ROV crews to operate deployment equipment.   10.2   Generators     Mobile generators can be used to supply system power onboard vessels and installations  where insufficient power is locally available or in situations where power is unstable or pr one  to disruption.     11.

If it is necessary to recover the  vehicle, then the pilot shall remain at the controls to advise all relevant personnel of the  veh icles position relative to any obstructions during the ascent.     Where practical, caged vehicles can be returned to the cage for normal recovery.     The pilot shall advise the supervisor and the winch operator of the vehicles depth whilst  ascending, also of t he vehicle position relative to any known obstacles, or from directions  shown on the rig/vessel navigation system.     When nearing the surface, the vehicle position can be ascertained by observing the direction  of the umbilical.     If on a vessel the bridge  shall be informed to allow maneuvering of the vessel to bring the  ROV under the launch site.     Once on surface, the vehicle is recovered in the normal manner.   15.3   Loss of ROV Single Phase Electrical Supply     This shall result in the loss of all controls and syst ems other than the USBL transponder on the  ROV and where required the TMS.     These sensors will provide basic positioning information.     The pilot shall monitor the navigation system during the ascent. The approximate depth may  be obtained from either the tr ansponder or the amount of umbilical that is deployed.     15.4   Loss of Tether Control / TMS  -   Caged Vehicles     In the event that the caged vehicle cannot be reeled in:     The vehicle shall be flown to the cage following the tether ensuring that it is clear of snaggi ng  points, driving well away from any obstructions in order to pull the tether clear, and then  checking all is clear before moving the TMS/Cage.     Visually inspect the TMS/Cage to ascertain the cause of failure and whether any remedial  action can be taken.  If possible try to dock the vehicle into the TMS/Cage and recover with a  loop of tether below the TMS/Cage, after ensuring it will not snag on any obstructions.     If enough tethers are paid out, and weather conditions are favourable, bring the TMS/Cage on  d eck to carry out repairs. It is necessary to monitor the ROV on the surface during this  operation if the ROV  cannot safely reach the seabed.

Its reproduction and / or distribution to third  parties are not permitted without prior approval  from the Kreuz Subsea Management     15.5   ROV Entrapment     Remember  -   do not apply excessive pull on the umbilical without clearance from Base.  Damage to  the umbilical will result in the loss of the vehicle systems and may possibly sever  the umbilical completely.     The umbilical may be used to assist in freeing an unpowered vehicle by cross hauling. A cross  haul may be applied in several ways:        By lowering a   clump weight on a running sheave;      By lowering a weighted drogue when the tidal flow is correct.     A steady but gentle pulsating pull may then be applied in the required direction.     Use any aids available, e.g. rig camera, navigation beacon, and sonar. It m ay be possible to  obtain assistance from another vehicle. Ensure the client and Vessel Master are fully aware of  the situation. Seek their advice and clearance to proceed with the action that has also been  approved by the Kreuz Subsea base.   15.6   Positively Buoy ant Vehicle / Severed Umbilical     Assuming the vehicle is not snagged or weighted down by a long length of umbilical, the  vehicle will ascend to the surface where it will, hopefully, be located and recovered, with the  help of a USBL transponder and flasher  unit.     The vessel Master shall be made aware of the situation immediately to allow any actions to  commence, e.g. shutdown of DP thrusters, and to warn local shipping to stand clear.   15.7   Negatively Buoyant Vehicle / Severed Umbilical     In this instance, little  can be done without the help of a second system. The location of the  vehicle shall be monitored using the navigation beacon. If the vehicle can be observed on a rig  TV or second ROV, then recovery may be achieved by use of grapple hook attached to a  tugger .   15.8   Partially Severed Umbilical     Wait for suitable weather, then attempt recovery to surface, but do not lifts clear of the water  Ensure standby services are available in the recovery area.     Ensure a secondary lift line is available to be attached to the veh icle or TMS lift point as soon  as the system reaches the surface. The attachment of the lift line shall be carried out from the  standby rescue boat.             MANUAL     Page  32   of  46   Revision No: 3         This document  is a property of  Kreuz Subsea.

It is Kreuz Subsea policy to assist the Clients operations without   resorting to additional  manning for short periods of extended operations if requested (i.e. more than 12 hours  per day). Short periods are taken as an occasional duration of 24 - 36 hours. If  operations are required for more than 12 hours per day for longer   periods, manning  levels shall be increased to a 6 man team required for continuous 24 hour operations of  work - class ROV Systems.     If extra manning has not been supplied within a reasonable period, then operations will  cease and the vehicle will be recover ed to allow the ROV crew to rest.     Tasks where additional manning may be necessary are:        Gas bubble watch;      Template installation;      Difficult ROV rig installation;            MANUAL     Page  39   of  46   Revision No: 3         This document  is a property of  Kreuz Subsea.
